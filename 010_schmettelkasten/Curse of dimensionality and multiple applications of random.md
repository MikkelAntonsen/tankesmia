# Curse of dimensionality and multiple applications of random

If you plot points in the unit circle where the distance from origo is given by $l=1-random(random(random(...)))$ where the random function is applied x times, the points will concentrate in the shell of the circle.

How is this related to the curse of dimensionality.

The curse of dimensionality states that in higher dimensions randomly distributed numbers will be concentrated in an epsilon shell around the hypersphere. 

The multiple applications of random is the same as the multiple axes of a hypersphere.
Thought about in this way, every time you fix a point on one axis in the hypersphere, you limit how close to the center the hyperpoint can be...?
