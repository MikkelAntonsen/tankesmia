# ClearML - Agroscout

Agroscout faces similar annotations challenges to us in stingray. They have experts that use different terminology, uses terminology inconsistently (also relative to themselves) and experts that don't necessarily agree on annotations.

They solve this they used clearml dataset statistics (tm!) to map the differences and create rules to unify them.
We solve this by having experts discussing and making rules between themselves. Such as, "you need two indications", "look for 3d structure" etc.
