Frozen broccoli and brussel sprouts. 3 cups of water in the instant pot and cook on high pressure for 1 minute. Coat with oil, salt and put in the oven on 240c with conviction for 15 minutes. Carrots were sliced in 3-4mm slices and put in the oven with broccoli and brussel sprouts.

Broccoli and brussel sprouts were mushy, try 0 minutes next time. Might also be due to them being frozen.
They were somewhat crispy (broccoli) and very tasty though.

Carrots were perfectly tender, but could have been in the oven a bit longer.
