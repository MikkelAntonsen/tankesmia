### Making progress

When working towards a goal or with something hard, at some point hopelessness will take over. Doubt will make you question if there's a better way or if you're on the right path. Need some assurance that you in fact are and that the difficulty is worth working through.
What assurance could work?
1. Having an authority validate the goal.
