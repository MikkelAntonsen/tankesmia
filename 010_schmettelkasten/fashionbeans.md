Actionable:
- Start with plain black and white. Add accents after.
- Buy plain sweatshirts without logo in neutral colors that will fit both joggers and chinos
- Buy a few oxford shirts.
- Only one Chambray shirt. Not a fan of these I think, a medium rugged one is probably best
- [[Buy rollneck]]
- Breton top that can serve as t-shirt, but also under a blazer
- Knitted jumper - one thin for suit, one for colder situations. Neutral + burgundy/mustard
- Tailored shorts
- 2 Chinos, tan and navy. If 3rd, make it wide leg.
- Am I buying an overcoat?
- Bomber jacket - I like these, but less is more here.

Opinions:
1. keep to plain tshirts, logos are always terrible?
2. keep jeans slim and simple
3. oxford shirts: off-duty casual shirts. Fit is most important. Block colors - ideally neutral. Should fit under a jacket, but not figure-hug.
4. If you [[Buy rollneck]] one, make it black. If you buy a second, try a jewel tone, like emerald.
