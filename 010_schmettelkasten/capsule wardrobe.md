Concepts:

1. Every item does at least 2 jobs. New purchases work in at least 3 outfits.
2. Every item should have staying power - buy things that do not go out of style

We are gonne stick to one palette. We aim for colors that all go together, which means we need neutral colors. Navys, greys, browns, drabs, blacks are suggested.

What do I do day to day and week to week:
1. Go to work
2. Chill in cafes
3. Sit at home
4. Do climb/going to be swimming
5. Go on dates
6.
