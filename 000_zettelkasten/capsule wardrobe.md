Concepts:

1. Every item does at least 2 jobs. New purchases work in at least 3 outfits.
2. Every item should have staying power - buy things that do not go out of style

We are gonne stick to one palette. We aim for colors that all go together, which means we need neutral colors. Navys, greys, browns, drabs, blacks are suggested.
