# Continuous U-Net: Faster, Greater and Noiseless 

Promises to fix U-Net.

Problems with Unet:
- fixed receptive field size
- does not account for noise in predictions (what does this mean?)
- unets are discrete, but medial imaging data is continous (what does this mean?)
- U-net lacks theoretical underpinning (aren't skip-connections known to smoothen the loss surface?)
